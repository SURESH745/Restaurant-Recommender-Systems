# Restaurant Recommender System

## Introduction
The **Restaurant Recommender System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to suggest restaurants based on user preferences, location, and past interactions. It leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach to deliver personalized recommendations.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests restaurants based on user preferences and historical data.
- **Location-Based Filtering:** Prioritizes nearby dining options for convenience.
- **User Review Analysis:** Uses sentiment analysis to refine recommendations.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Approaches:**
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based)
  - Hybrid Approach
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GongaliSuresh/restaurant-recommender.git
   cd restaurant-recommender
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and test the model.

## Usage
- Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
- Train the recommendation models using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
