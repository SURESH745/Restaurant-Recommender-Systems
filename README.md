(Add an image or GIF of your project if available.)

📌 Introduction
The Restaurant Recommender System helps users find the best restaurants based on their preferences and previous interactions. By leveraging machine learning, it analyzes customer behavior, reviews, and restaurant attributes to provide personalized recommendations.

🛠️ Features
✔ Personalized Recommendations – Suggests restaurants based on user history and preferences.
✔ Hybrid Model – Combines collaborative filtering & content-based filtering for accuracy.
✔ Real-Time API Integration – Fetches updated restaurant information dynamically.
✔ Data-Driven Insights – Uses NLP to analyze customer reviews for sentiment analysis.

🚀 Problem Statement
With thousands of restaurants available, customers struggle to choose the right one. This system aims to enhance user experience by recommending suitable restaurants based on factors like:

User preferences (cuisine type, location, budget, etc.)
Ratings & Reviews
Past Orders & Interactions
📊 Data Collection & Processing
Data Sources: Public datasets, restaurant APIs, user-generated reviews.
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering.
Key Features Used: Cuisine type, location, price range, customer ratings, past orders.
⚙️ Methodology
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends & patterns in restaurant data.
📌 Clustering (K-Means & Hierarchical): Grouping similar restaurants.
🤝 Collaborative Filtering: Recommending restaurants based on user behavior.
📝 Content-Based Filtering: Suggesting similar restaurants based on attributes.
📊 Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

📈 Results & Findings
✅ Implemented a hybrid recommender model (collaborative + content-based filtering).
✅ Achieved 15% improvement in recommendation accuracy.
✅ Integrated real-time API for live restaurant updates.
